I participated in the Hungarian Cup of the 16th International 24-hour Programming Contest (http://ch24.org/) 2016.06.23-26. Budapest, Hungary.

I made these solutions during the contest. They are not the most beautiful and designed code, but they work as fast as they had to. There are some trial too, which I tried to solve the tasks, but I couldn't finish it. If you have questions, contact me antal[dooot]janos[dooot]benjamin[aaat]gmail[dooot]com.
